On server start, the friend finder application takes the user through a survey that takes in their name and a picture, as well as responses to 10 survey questions. If any fields are left blank, an alert will pop up on submit letting the user know they need to fill out everything.

Upon filling out the completed form, the app shows you your closest Marvel actor match, and adds you to the friends list with your name and the picture you supplied.

If you take the survey again with the same or close-to the same opinions, you'll get yourself as your best friend!
